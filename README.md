Simple Java programs demonstrating multithreading, socket programming, and thread pooling.
This repo contains:

A basic multithreaded server (manual thread creation)
A client that spawns 100 concurrent connections
A thread-pool based server using ExecutorService

These examples show how concurrency behaves with and without a thread pool, and how servers can scale with multiple clients.
