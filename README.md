# Multithreaded Java Server Examples

A collection of simple yet illustrative Java programs demonstrating **multithreading**, **socket programming**, and **thread pooling**.

This repo contains:

1. **A basic multithreaded server** (manual thread creation)  
2. **A client** that spawns 100 concurrent connections  
3. **A thread-pool based server** using `ExecutorService`

These examples show how concurrency behaves with and without a thread pool, and how servers can scale with multiple clients.
